# HELLO RUSTY

> all tutorials are from the `EDX course` linked here~
`RUST PROGRAMMING > RUST FUNDAMENTALS`

## lec 1: familiarizing with the env
1. creating cargo projects as library and executable
2. cargo.toml file
3. makefiles and other settings for source code
4. tests for rust libraries 

## lec 2: basics
1. variables!
2. SCOPES in rust
3. help/explain commands in rust compiler
4. basic control Statements and Expressions
5. shadowing variables
6. crates are compilable units of rust code. cargo is the tool to handle rust crates

## lec 3: loops and control flow
1. loop keyword (same as while true in python)
2. Some() and Option in rust are used for handeling none values
3. while loop, for loop and it's ways
4. macros are magic!
5. vectors? damn: a growable array
6. _continue_ statement skips the itteration and moves to next itteration. _break_ statement gets out of loop
7. match (similar to case in python)

> In Rust, if no return type is specified for the main function, it implicitly returns the unit type (). The unit type is represented by an empty tuple () and signifies the absence of a meaningful value. It's used in situations where a function needs to return, but there's no significant value to return.
